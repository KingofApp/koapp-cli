### Usage

King of App Command-Line Interface provides developers some helpful commands that can assist you while you build your app.

You have the following command tools which you can use:

*Note: all commands should be executed from the base folder that will contain all your project files.*

* ``koapp init <projectName>``

  Create a new King of App Project on the given path and download our [Visualizer]('http://docs.kingofapp.com/visualizer') to preview your app.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp init
  ~~~

* ``koapp create <module|spinner|theme|service>``

  Create a new module, spinner, theme or service. An assistant will ask you for some parameters.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp create module
  
  koapp create service
  ~~~

* ``koapp serve``

  This command will launch King of App Visualizer at ```http://localhost:9001```. You need to be inside the King of App Visualizer folder of your project.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp serve
  ~~~

* ``koapp add <module|spinner|theme|service> <pluginName>``

  Use this command to download and install modules, themes, spinners or services in your application. After you download a module, an assistant will guide you with the routes.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp add module test

  koapp add service test
  ~~~

* ``koapp remove <service|module> <serviceIdentifier|moduleMenuPath>``

  Use this command to remove a service or a module to your application. To remove a service you need to pass its indentifier. To remove a module you need to pass its menu path inside your application.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp remove service test

  koapp remove module "/menu-abcd/test-abcd/"
  ~~~

* ``koapp build <cordovaProjectName> <platform>``

  Create and build your Cordova project with all its dependencies for the selected platform. You need [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?hl=es-419) or [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to build your project.

  If you want your own icon and splash, you can replace them on 'com.kingofapp.visualizer/www/images' yourself. The splash screen image should be 2208x2208 px with a square center of around 1200x1200 px

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp build ProjectName android

  koapp build ProjectName ios
  ~~~

* ``koapp emulate <platform>``

  Emulate your app using native Android or IOs emulator.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp emulate
  ~~~

* ``koapp <help | -h | --help>``

  Display the list of avaliable commands and some help.

  Example:
  ~~~
  koapp help

  koapp -h

  koapp --help
  ~~~
